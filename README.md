 I am pspiagicw, AND YES THIS ENTIRE PROFILE IS INSIDE A CODE BLOCK.

 If you didn't already guess, I like terminals and systems programming. 
 I work as a Compiler Engineer and that's where most of my passion pours into.

 Some projects, you might find useful. (They should be pinned or recommended automatically).
