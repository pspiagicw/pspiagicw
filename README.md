I am pspiagicw, and yes this README is inside a code block. Cause thats what I like.

I work with terminals and remote servers in my spare time.

I am a Machine Learning Engineer by academia.
A Compiler Engineer by profession
But a hardcore geek by passion.

Some projects, you might find useful (They should be pinned or recommended automatically)

gox - A Golang Binary Package Manager (Something akin to npx or pipx but for Golang)
qemantra - An alternate easy to use CLI frontend to QEMU/KVM
groom - Yet another Makefile alternative for Golang.
shog - Serve your blogs over SSH (WIP)
dotback - Yet another dotfile backup utility.(It's different I swear)

You may also find my blog useful or interesting. Just don't expect anything regular

https://itspspiagicw.com

I primarily use Golang, C or Python, and that's what you will find here.

I also have a collection of compilers/interpreters I work on for learning and work purposes. You may find them useful for your learning.

boombash - A LISP interpreter written in Pure Python to transpile to Bash.
hotshot - A kind of rewrite of boombash.
jlox - A compiler/interpreter rewrite of the one written in `Crafting Interpreter`
uranus - A compiler/interpreter imlementation of the one in `Crafting a Interprter/Compiler in Go`

Thanks for checking out my profile. Bye!
